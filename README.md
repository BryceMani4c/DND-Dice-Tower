## 📌 About  
This project focused on updating and modernizing legacy prints from Nitrous Racing Connections (NRC) to create accurate, manufacturable CAD designs for nitrous system components. Using Autodesk Inventor and Fusion 360, detailed 2D and 3D models were drafted for parts such as fuel rails, throttle bodies, and flange plates.

Quality checks were performed on each model and drawing to ensure accuracy, completeness, and compliance with design standards and specifications. Collaboration with company stakeholders was an essential part of the process, helping resolve design-related issues and ensuring the final outputs were optimized for manufacturability.

A key deliverable of the project was the design of nitrous injection solenoid base plates for Subaru engines, taking outdated references and transforming them into precise, production-ready CAD models.
